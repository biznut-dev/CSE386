# Ethan Davila's CSE 386 Project
This code base includes the work I did for CSE 386. Some of the code was provided to us, particularly the much of the driver files. Specifically, the setup of the rendering using glut was done for us in these driver files. Most of the code in the header files was also provided to us, but I was required to modify or add to some of them in order to meet the needs of the different programs. The most notable programs that I implemented are the raytracing project and the various object order rendering activities.
