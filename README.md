# Ethan Davila's CSE 386 Code Base
This code base includes the work I did for CSE 386. Some of the code was provided to us, particularly the much of the driver files. Notably, the setup of the rendering using glut was done for me in these driver files. Most of the code in the header files was also provided to me, but I was required to modify or add to some of them in order to meet the needs of the different programs. The most notable programs that I implemented are the raytracing project and the various object order rendering activities.

- Raytrace Project
  - Driver: raytracer.cpp
  - Video Demonstration: Raytrace Project Final.mp4
  - Overview Document: Project Raytrace.pdf

- Object Order Rendering Activities (Note: Much of the code for the back-end of the rendering pipeline was provided to me. I was required to implement the definitions of different 3D shapes, transformations, color and depth buffer, and lighting.)
  - Drivers:
    - Exercise3DTransformations.cpp
    - exercisepipelineshadinghiddensurfaces.cpp
